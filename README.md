# Java REST API Template

This is a basic template for a Java REST API service.
I had a lot of trouble getting started with this at first and then found myself
needing to creating this a lot.
So, I've made a general basic template to make getting started easier.

## Requirements for deployment

* Java 8+
* Tomcat 8+

## Server path on ROOT

1. Window -> Show View -> Other -> Server
1. Double click on Tomcat
1. Modules tab -> Change path to '/'
